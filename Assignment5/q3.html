        This is the main content of our corporate website. <br />
        A corporation is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its
        owners. Under the law, corporations possess many of the same rights and
        responsibilities as individuals. They can enter contracts, loan and
        borrow money, sue and be sued, hire employees, own assets, and pay
        taxes.
        <br />

        A corporation's distinguishing characteristic is limited liability.
        Shareholders profit through dividends and stock appreciation but are not
        personally liable for the company's debts. Almost all large businesses
        are corporations, including Microsoft Corp. <br> and Coca-Cola Co. Some
        corporations do business under their names and separate business names,
        such as Alphabet Inc., which does business as Google. KEY TAKEAWAYS
        Corporations possess many of the same legal rights and responsibilities
        as individuals. Limited liability of a corporation means that its
        shareholders are not personally responsible for the company's debts. A
        corporation may be created by an individual or a group of people.
        Corporation Investopedia / Julie Bang Incorporation A corporation is
        created when it is incorporated by a group of shareholders with a common
        goal who share ownership represented by their holding of stock shares.
        Corporations may return a profit to their shareholders. <br> However, some
        corporations, such as charities or fraternal organizations, are
        nonprofit or not-for-profit. A private or "closed corporation" may have
        a single shareholder or several. Publicly-traded corporations have many
        shareholders. In the U.S., corporations are created and regulated by
        state laws. Public corporations are regulated by federal law through the
        Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). <br> Both a limited liability
        company (LLC) and a corporation offer similar legal advantages to their
        owners: they cannot be held personally liable for the debts of either
        entity. Legal Requirements Each state has laws regarding incorporation.
        Most states require the owners to file articles of incorporation with
        the state and then issue stock to the company's shareholders. <br>1 The
        shareholders elect the board of directors in an annual meeting. Turning
        a private corporation into a public corporation is complex, as it falls
        under federal laws requiring full and public disclosure of financial
        information to potential shareholders and the government. Operating a
        Corporation The shareholders of a corporation typically receive one vote
        per share and may hold an annual meeting during which they elect a board
        of directors. The board hires and oversees the senior management
        responsible for the corporation's day-to-day activities. The board of
        directors executes the corporation's business plan. Although the members
        are not personally responsible for the corporation's debts, they owe a
        duty of care to the corporation and can incur personal liabilities if
        they neglect this duty. Some tax statutes also provide for the personal
        liabilities of the board of directors. 2 Liquidating a Corporation The
        incorporation can be ended using the process called liquidation. This
        may be a voluntary decision to cease operations or may be forced by the
        financial collapse of the business. A company appoints a liquidator who
        sells the corporation's assets. The company pays any creditors and
        distributes any remaining money to the shareholders. An involuntary
        liquidation is triggered by the creditors of a corporation that has
        failed to pay its bills. If the situation cannot be resolved, it is
        followed by a filing for bankruptcy. <br> 3 What Is a Corporation vs. a
        Business? Many businesses are corporations, and vice versa. A business
        may seek to incorporate existing as a legal entity separate from its
        owners. This means that the owners cannot be held responsible for the
        debts of the corporation. <br>It also means that the corporation can own
        assets, sue or be sued, and borrow money.
