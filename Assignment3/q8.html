            <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
                The threats of hackers and crackers is for real, and is alike for everyone. If the security <br>breach at Bhabha Atomic Research center last year by the hacker group milOwrm <br>didn't convince you of their capabilities ,then consider this: Jmaes Davis aka jdavis_4,a <br> resident of <strong>www.geocities.com/silicaVelly/Bit/2483</strong> homestead community on the <br> Internet ,might just be reading your e-mail in the mailbox right now ,or using your <br> account for some benign Internet suffering ,or exchanging it with someone else on the Net <br> for many more such accounts! <br>
                surprished? or Scared? <br>
    
                whatever it is,jdavis_4 claims in his home page-Free VSNL passwords-that he has got <br>exactly 108 working VSNL passwords (and growing daily),<strong>36 satyam,31 MTNL,11</strong> <br>WmiNet and 23 Mantra online passwords.
